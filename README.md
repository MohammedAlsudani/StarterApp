# Starter App

Starter App is a robust Android application template that follows best practices and utilizes modern Android development tools and libraries. It provides a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable Android apps.

## Features and Best Practices

### 1. Build Source

Ensure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed. Use the following commands to build the source code:

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

### 2. MVVM Architecture

Starter App follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, promoting a clear separation of concerns. The architecture is structured as follows:
- **View:** Responsible for displaying data and user interface.
- **ViewModel:** Manages UI-related data and business logic, communicates with the repository.
- **Interactor:** Implements business logic and communicates with the repository.
- **Repository:** Acts as a single source of truth for data, handling data operations and exposing clean APIs to the rest of the application.

### 3. Hilt Dependency Injection

Hilt is used for dependency injection, providing a standard way to inject dependencies into Android components. This promotes modularization and easier testing.

### 4. Data Binding

Data Binding is employed to bind UI components in layouts to data sources in the app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.

### 5. Room Database

Room Database is utilized for local data storage, providing a robust, type-safe, and convenient way to work with SQLite databases on Android.

### 6. Jetpack Compose

Jetpack Compose is the modern Android UI toolkit used for building native UIs. It simplifies and accelerates UI development, promoting a more reactive and concise approach.

### 7. DataSource

Starter App uses a DataSource pattern for handling data sources efficiently, ensuring a smooth user experience and optimal performance.

### 8. Multi-Module Architecture

The project is structured with multiple modules, including a common module that contains code shared across different features or layers of the application.

### 9. Custom Fonts

Custom fonts are integrated into the app for a personalized and visually appealing user experience.

### 10. Network Handler with Retrofit

Retrofit is used for making network requests, and a custom network handler is implemented to manage network-related operations effectively.
